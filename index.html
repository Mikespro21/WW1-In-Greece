    <p>At the outbreak of WWI in August 1914, Greece remained neutral. Nonetheless, in October 1914, Greek forces once again occupied Northern Epirus, from where they had retreated after the end of the Balkan Wars. The disagreement between King Constantine, who favored neutrality, and the pro-Allied Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos led to the division of the state into two rival governments. Finally, Greece united and joined the Allies in the summer of 1917.</p>
    <p>Greece had emerged victorious from the 1912–1913 Balkan Wars with its territory almost doubled, but found itself in a difficult international situation. The status of the Greek-occupied eastern Aegean islands was left undetermined, and the Ottoman Empire continued to claim them, leading to a naval arms race and mass expulsions of ethnic Greeks from Anatolia. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, harbored plans for revenge against Greece and Serbia.</p>
    <p>Greece and Serbia were bound by a treaty of alliance signed on June 1, 1913, which promised reciprocal military assistance in case of attack by a third party, referring to Bulgaria. However, in mid-1914, Greece confronted the Ottoman Empire over the Aegean islands. On June 11, the Greek government issued an official protest to the Porte, threatening to break relations or even go to war if the persecutions of Greeks were not stopped. On June 12, Greece requested Serbia’s help, but on June 16, Serbia replied that, due to its exhaustion and regional threats, it could not commit to helping. On June 19, the Greek Army Staff Service, under Lt. Colonel Ioannis Metaxas, presented military options, including a sudden occupation of Gallipoli and Constantinople to force negotiations. But the Ottomans had just proposed joint talks, and tensions began to ease.</p>
    <p>Although the Austro-Serbian war was initially seen as a localized conflict, the Greek leadership agreed to remain neutral. Greece was ready to join the war only if Bulgaria intervened, which would change the balance of power in the Balkans. As the war expanded, the Balkan countries' previous plans collapsed. Romania’s neutrality also meant Greece had no regional allies and was diplomatically isolated.</p>
    <p>Greece’s political leadership was also split on the war’s likely outcome. Venizelos believed Britain would win in the Near East and saw Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire as aligned with Germany. He considered cooperation with the Allies essential, especially to counter Ottoman aggression. Though willing to stay neutral for the time being, Venizelos aimed to join the Allies if Bulgaria attacked Serbia or if Greece received favorable offers.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, King Constantine I, supported by Foreign Minister Georgios Streit and the General Staff, believed in Germany’s inevitable victory and supported permanent neutrality. Streit feared pan-Slavism and trusted the traditional European balance of power to remain unchanged, doubting Greece could gain much from joining the war. Constantine and his advisors admired German militarism, and ideological differences deepened the rift between him and Venizelos, who represented liberal democracy, while the King aligned with conservative elites. Metaxas, the Chief of the General Staff, was already leaning toward proto-Fascist ideas.</p>
    <p>The disagreement surfaced on August 6, when Streit resigned after clashing with Venizelos, but both Venizelos and the King prevented the resignation to avoid a political crisis. When Serbia requested help under their alliance on July 25, Venizelos responded on August 2 that Greece would remain neutral, citing Serbia’s failure to meet its military obligations and the risk of provoking Bulgaria. However, both the King and Venizelos agreed to reject Germany’s demand on July 27 for Greece to join the Central Powers.</p>
    <p>In the end, Greece joined the Allies and played a significant role in their victory during the war. As a result of its contributions, Greece was rewarded with a substantial amount of territory in the post-war agreements. However, this territorial gain was short-lived. In the years that followed, Greece became involved in further conflicts—most notably the Greco-Turkish War—which ultimately led to the loss of much of the land it had acquired. Despite its initial success and the promise of expansion, Greece faced significant setbacks that reshaped its borders once again.</p>
